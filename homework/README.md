## CS162 Programming Assignments

The main goal of the programming assignments in CS162 is to build λ<sup>+</sup>, a small programming language from scratch.

1. [Grab your weapon! OCaml in action](hw1/)
   
   Since you will use OCaml to implement your λ<sup>+</sup> programming language, in this assignment, you will complete some basic programming tasks (e.g., recursions, pattern matching, data types, etc.) in OCaml as the warm-up.


2. [Higher order functions in OCaml + Interpreting λ<sup>+</sup>](hw2/) <br />

   In this assignment, you will first practice defining and using higher order functions in OCaml. Next, you will implement an interpreter for a subset of λ<sup>+</sup> based on its operational semantics.

3. [Interpreting λ<sup>+</sup> (continued)](hw3/) <br />

   In this assignment, you will  finish the interpreter for the full λ<sup>+</sup> language.

<!-- 
1. [Interpreting your λ<sup>+</sup> code (part 1): 15%](hw3/) <br/>
In this assignment, you will use OCaml to implement an interpreter for a subset of λ<sup>+</sup> based on its operational semantics.

1. [Interpreting your λ<sup>+</sup> code (part 2): 15%](hw4/) <br/>
In this assignment, you will finish the interpreter for the full λ<sup>+</sup> language.

1. [Type check your λ<sup>+</sup> program: 20%](hw5/) <br/>
In this assignment, you will write a type checker for your λ<sup>+</sup> program such that your checker can reject ill-typed λ<sup>+</sup> programs. 

1. [Infer the types for your λ<sup>+</sup> code: 20%](hw6/) <br/>
In this assignment, you will implement the type inference algorithm that we learn in the class. -->

<!-- 
6. (**Optional**) Verify your λ<sup>+</sup> code (Extra credit): 2% <br/>
Difficulty: **** <br/>
In this assignment, you will leverage an existing symbolic evaluation engine (i.e., Rosette) to verify the correctness of your λ<sup>+</sup> programs. -->
