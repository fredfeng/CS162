## CS162 Programming Assignments

The main goal of the programming assignments in CS162 is to build λ<sup>+</sup>, a small programming language from scratch.

1. Get familiar with λ<sup>+</sup>: 15% <br />
Difficulty: * <br />
In this assignment, you will be accomplishing some basic programming tasks (simple arithmetic, function calls, etc.) in λ<sup>+</sup>.

2. Grab your weapon! OCaml in action: 15% <br />
Difficulty: * <br />
Since you will use OCaml to implement your λ<sup>+</sup> programming language, in this assignment, you will complete some basic programming tasks (e.g., pattern matching, high-order functions, recursions, data types, etc.) in OCaml as the warm-up.

3. Interpreting your λ<sup>+</sup> code: 15% <br/>
Difficulty: *** <br/>
In this assignment, you will implement an interpreter for your λ<sup>+</sup> program using OCaml. The operational semantics of λ<sup>+</sup> can be found in its reference manual.

4. Type check your λ<sup>+</sup> program: 15% <br/>
Difficulty: *** <br/>
In this assignment, you will write a type checker for your λ<sup>+</sup> program such that your checker can reject ill-typed λ<sup>+</sup> programs. 

5. Infer the types for your λ<sup>+</sup> code: 15% <br/>
Difficulty: *** <br/>
In this assignment, you will implement the type inference algorithm that we learn in the class.

6. (**Optional**) Verify your λ<sup>+</sup> code (Extra credit): 2% <br/>
Difficulty: **** <br/>
In this assignment, you will leverage an existing symbolic evaluation engine (i.e., Rosette) to verify the correctness of your λ<sup>+</sup> programs.
